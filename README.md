---

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- A virtual environment (recommended)
- OpenAI API access

### Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/paris-trip-planner.git
cd paris-trip-planner

# Create and activate virtual env
python3 -m venv paris
source paris/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI=your_openai_api_key_here
```

The notebook uses `python-dotenv` to load this key and pass it to the OpenAI client securely.

---

## How It Works

### Initialization
The assistant is initialized with a system prompt that defines its personality as a helpful Parisian tour guide.

### User Input & Chat Completion
Users provide questions (e.g., *"What should I see in Montmartre?"*) and the OpenAI API responds using `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

### Session Memory (Future Scope)
The project is structured to later include session memory, personalization, or prompt chaining for longer itineraries.
